                            <span role="img">üëãüèª</span> Hi, I'm Long, but also go
                            by Jack. I'm a rising senior at the University of
                            Cincinnati. I'm pursuing a BS degree in Computer
                            Science with an anticipated graduation in May 2025.
                            I'm most passionate about solving real world
                            problems, advocating sustainability, and building
                            community-driven applications.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <span role="img">‚ú®</span> I appreciate every
                            challenge I came across that helped cultivate my
                            self-efficacy in this risk-taking world. At STEAM
                            for Vietnam, I have a chance to work with many great
                            and talented people to delivery high-end computer
                            science course to Vietnamese children. I learned the
                            importance of staying open-minded to changes,
                            whether to be adapted to new environment,
                            programming languages, or attitudes. I feel
                            motivated as I discover ways to improve flexibility
                            and creative through ongoing discussions with others
                            to address a customer's changing needs.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <span role="img">‚õ±Ô∏è</span> I love cleaning and
                            organize my workplace. I feel like if I can keep my
                            work area clean, I can successfully do other things
                            as well. I love reading and listening. I used to
                            spend hours to read the History of Greek ~quite
                            interesting indeed~. Coming to American, I found out
                            that I actually enjoy cooking for my friends as it
                            can help me to relieve stress from working and
                            studying.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <span role="img">üóΩ</span> What motivates me to get
                            up and get ready for work is the knowledge that I
                            have another opportunity to deliver love and
                            camaraderie to my neighborhood. I thrive in
                            occupations that promote variety and culture, and I
                            appreciate working with people from all walks of
                            life to achieve a common goal. Not only do I regard
                            it as an opportunity to gain new knowledge, but also
                            to connect profoundly with individuals through their
                            diverse perspectives on situations. I strive to be a
                            team player, to be aware of those around me's needs
                            and desires, and to thrive on positive
                            reinforcement.
